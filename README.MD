**Infinite Container - (for now just Dispensors and Droppers)**
Infinite Containers allows you to set a container to dispense infinitely
The locations are stored or saved between server restarts to ensure preservation through a restart

If you add the inventory once you have created a container it will increment those items as well. *Caveat* - you should add atleast 2 items in a stack to ensure they are picked up.  This means for potions its recommended you add them before you create the container.  1 item is fine on creation.

To Create type `/icadd` and rightclick the container to add.

To remove type `/icremove` and rightick the container to remove.

To list all type `/iclist`

Created for the AddstarMC Server Network.
